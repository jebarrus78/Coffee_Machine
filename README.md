Coffee_Machine
==============

Simple console-based coffee machine simulator written in Python.

What this repo contains
- `main.py` - main program that runs the coffee machine loop
- `art.py` - ASCII art/logo used by the program

Usage
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional):
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
2. Run the program:
   python main.py

Notes
- I removed IDE, venv, and compiled Python files from tracking and rewrote repository history to purge them from all commits.
- If you collaborate with others, rewriting history requires everyone to re-clone the repo.

If you want me to avoid rewriting history and instead just stop tracking those files going forward, tell me and I will revert the history rewrite.
